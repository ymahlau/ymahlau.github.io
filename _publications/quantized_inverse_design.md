The inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) presents distinctive computational challenges, including their large memory requirements. 
Advancements in the two-photon polymerization (2PP) fabrication process introduce additional complexity, necessitating the development of more flexible optimization algorithms to enable the creation of multi-material 3D structures with unique properties. 
This paper presents a memory efficient reverse-mode automatic differentiation framework for finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations that is able to handle complex constraints arising from novel fabrication methods. 
Our method is based on straight-through gradient estimation that enables non-differentiable shape parametrizations. 
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by creating increasingly complex structures to solve the coupling problem in PICs. 
The results highlight the potential of our method for future PIC design and practical applications.
